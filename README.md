# Set List CRUD

This was built while working through Module 2 in the Turing backend open courseware program. It was used as a tutorial to learn how to create a CRUD app on Rails.

Run tests using bundle exec rspec.
There is a seeds.rb file if you want to use it.
Use rails s to run on a localhost.

Use
    /songs
    /artists
    /playlists
to access index pages and use basic CRUD functions.
